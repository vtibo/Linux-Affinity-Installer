A comprehensive solution for running [Affinity software](https://www.affinity.studio/) on GNU/Linux systems using Wine with hardware acceleration support.

<img width="1275" height="1323" alt="Affinity Linux Installer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b04e7307-ed95-484d-931a-713aadfe6c47" />

## What is This?

AffinityOnLinux provides an easy way to install and run Affinity Photo, Designer, Publisher, and the unified Affinity v3 application on Linux. The installer automatically sets up Wine (a compatibility layer for running Windows applications) with all necessary configurations, dependencies, and optimizations.

## Quick Start

**New to Linux or want the easiest option?** Use the AppImage:

1. Download the AppImage from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ryzendew/AffinityOnLinux/releases/tag/Affinity-wine-10.10-Appimage)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x Affinity-3-x86_64.AppImage`
3. Run it: `./Affinity-3-x86_64.AppImage`

**Want full features and latest updates?** Use the Python GUI Installer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryzendew/AffinityOnLinux/refs/heads/main/AffinityScripts/AffinityLinuxInstaller.py | python3
```

<summary><strong>Python GUI Dependencies</strong></summary>

The installer will attempt to install PyQt6 automatically if missing. If automatic installation fails, install it manually:

**Arch/CachyOS/EndeavourOS/XeroLinux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S python-pyqt6
```

**Fedora/Nobara:**
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-pyqt6 python3-pyqt6-svg
```

**openSUSE (Tumbleweed/Leap):**
```bash
sudo zypper install python313-PyQt6
```

**PikaOS:** Does not work with GUI installer. Use AppImage instead.

**Ubuntu 25.10:** If you encounter GUI issues, also install:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pyqt6.qtsvg
```

## Important Notes

### Support Limitations

- **AMD/Intel GPU Issues:** I cannot fix OpenCL or Wine GPU bugs for AMD/Intel GPUs as I do not have access to these GPUs for testing. Use vkd3d-proton or DXVK instead (see [Hardware Acceleration](docs/HARDWARE-ACCELERATION.md)).
- **Unsupported Distributions:** No support provided for Bazzite, Manjaro. Use AppImage at your own risk (see [System Requirements](docs/SYSTEM-REQUIREMENTS.md)).
